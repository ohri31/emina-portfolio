              function and serves the user to achieve their goals.

                The existing web platform is powerful, but how do you transfer
                it all to a smaller screen while still retaining all the
                functionality? The biggest challenge was to bring its core
                functionality to a mobile device. It was necessary to create a
                design that was both minimalistic and intuitive. Through this
                redesign, all changes made had to be fluid and logical to ensure
                a user-friendly application ready and easy to use on the go.

                Endobuddy is a mobile health app designed with the goal to
                support over 190 million women globally who suffer from
                endometriosis. The main goal of the project was to provide an
                all-in-one application that connects easy cycle monitoring to a
                deeper knowledge of a user's symptoms, daily activities, and
                health. The app allows users to track their symptoms, nutrition,
                lifestyle and other factors, and gives them a tailored data
                visualization. On top of that, the goal was to provide an
                AI-powered assistant that can help you understand all that data
                and give you proactive insights with the end goal of making the
                users condition bearable.

                The key problem was solving a vacuum in the women's health app
                industry, which mostly focuses on period monitoring and lacks
                solutions for people with complicated diseases like
                Endometriosis. User research shows that patients commonly use
                numerous apps to track periods, register pain, check diet, and
                seek community support, highlighting the need for an integrated
                solution. Competitor investigation revealed that previous
                applications had limited tracking choices, poor data
                presentation, absence of data export tools, and frequent
                technical difficulties such as data loss and errors. The
                objective was to create a user-centric application that
                consolidates all functions while providing customization and
                in-depth analysis, which existing solutions lack.

                discover user pain points and market potential. Based on the
                findings, I created a user persona to guide design decisions and
                outlined important features for the Minimum Viable Product

                including low-fidelity wireframes, high-fidelity screens, and
                flows, as well as the branding. This included creating important

                tracking systems, data analysis visualizations, AI assistants,
                and doctor-sharing features.
